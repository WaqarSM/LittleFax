# Little Fax
Straight a copy of Little Printer from BERG that isn't around anymore, but DIY.

Not all of the code is my own, some of it, esepcially the some of the css, is from codepen.io users! Too pretty not to study/use.

This is very much a work in progress - but if you are reading this, drop me a line with advice!
